# Time-dependent-shear-strength-beam
In the service life, RC beams may be subjected to some aggressive environment such as deicing salt and/or coastal/marine conditions, thus the steel reinforcement will be corroded due to the penetration of chloride ions and/or the carbonation of concrete cover. Corrosion may cause the failure modes of the beam to change from a flexural one to a shear one. Consequently, it is critical to accurately predict the shear strength of corroded RC (CRC) beams in their whole life-cycle. To this end, this work develops a time-dependent predictive model for the shear strength of CRC beams using one of the most representative ensemble machine learning algorithms, i.e., the gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT), in which a mechanical model is used to calculate the corrosion extent of reinforcements. The proposed time-dependent prediction model is capable to provide the shear strength of CRC beams with any given service time.
